# Who's Home?

This code will scan your network every 15 seconds, and check whether people's phones are currently on the network. If they are, it will send a POST request to the server that you provide, where you can find a neat way to display it!

Tested on a Raspberry Pi.
Comments in the code show you what to change to get it set up!

You will need to `pip install requests`

It's not super reliable code, so feel free to improve it!
